This is my Javascript 1 Course Assignment at Noroff.

- Make API call to https://rickandmortyapi.com/api/character/, 
- Loop through the results and create HTML for each result.

Index.html:
- Display at least 3 different properties.
- Link each result to the details.html page and pass a parameter in the query string to that page.
- Catch any errors and display a message on the page if an error occurs.

Details.html:
- Retrieve the parameter from the query string.
- Display at least 3 different properties from the received JSON on this page.
- Set the title of the HTML page to be one of the property values.
- Catch any errors and display a message on the page if an error occurs.

Contact.html:
- Create a form with the following inputs and validation rules.
- Name - required
- Email - must have a value and be formatted like an email address
- Message - must have a value with a minimum length of 10
When the form on this page is submitted, write code to validate the input. 
If any of the inputs fail validation display an error message for the relevant input.
If all validation passes, add a message above the form indicating the form passed validation.
